 *  This release of WUMprep has been partly rewritten in order to work with
    WUMprep4Weka, a plugin for the Java based Weka data mining environment.
    
    This release has not been tested for backwards compatibility with previous
    versions. It is considered being an development alpha-release, as further
    changes are necessary for full Weka integration.

 * When run in filter mode, sessionize.pl joins the session_id and host_id only
   if a sessionizeSeparator is defined in the config file, otherwise it pre-
   pends a new, comma-separated field "session_id" to the output. (cpohle)

0.11.0 (2005-10-15)
 * !!! NOTE: This release has only been tested to work with WUMprep4Weka. It
             might well be that the changes break former functionality! (cpohle)

 * Unified host_dns and host_name to host_dns in all files (inconsistent use
   before) (cpohle)

 * Adapted dnsLookup.pl to be able to use ArffParser (cpohle)

 * Added WUMprep::ArffParser.pm as an alternative input parser for reading
   and writing Weka ARFF files (cpohle)
   
 * Added wumPrep4WekaTest.pl for testing WUMprep4Weka (cpohle)
   
 * The constructor of Config.pm now takes an optional argument specifying
   the full path to an user-specified WUMprep configuration file

 * Added "vhost" as valid log field to LogfileParser.pm and logfileTemplate
   (cpohle)
   
 * Replaced my real e-mail address by a spam-protecting circumscription (cpohle)

0.10.0 (2005-08-20)


 * Changed the wumprep.conf format due to the config editor GUI's
   requirements:

   - Distinguish between configuration sections (denoted by "[sectionLabel]")
     and multi-value configuration settings (denoted by "setting =..." and the
     values following in subsequent lines) (cpohle)

   - "inputLogs" is now a multi-value setting in wumprep.conf instead of a
     section label. (cpohle)

   - Added and updated a number of comments for settings in wumprep.conf as
     they are used as context help in the config editor GUI. (cpohle)


0.9.2 (2003-10-23)

 * Several bugs in detectRobots.pl fixed and switched to the
   www.robotstxt.org robots database (cpohle)


0.9.1 (2003-28-09)

 * Fixed WUMprep::LogfileParser to parse log files independently
   of being in DOS or UNIX format (testet on Linux only) (cpohle)

 * Added missing anonymizerSettings section to the default
   wumprep.conf file (cpohle)

pre-0.9.1

 * Initial release under "official" versioning (cpohle)

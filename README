WARNING
========

THIS RELEASE IS CONSIDERED AN ALPHA-DEVELOPMENT VERSION!
READ THE NEWS FOR FURTHER DETAILS!

Introduction
=============

This is the README document for the WUMprep Perl scripts. They are
intended to be used for data preparation tasks in conjunction with the Web
Usage Mining software WUM.


News / Upgrading
=================

Please check the file NEWS for instructions that might be relevant to you
if you are upgrading from a previous version of WUMprep.


General usage
==============

Most of the configuration options necessary for applying the WUMprep
scripts to logfile data are defined in a file called 'wumprep.conf'. This
file should be stored in the directory containing the data to process,
which should also be the working directory when running the tools. A sample
configuration file is included in the script directory, see this file for
further documentation.

In order to process a log file, you must provide a template file describing
the format of the log file. See the sample 'logfileTemplate' file in the
script directory for details.


Java-based coniguration editor
===============================

WUMprep comes with a small Java application for editing the WUMprep 
configuration file 'wumprep.conf' in a more convenient way. You can find
the config editor in the configEditor subdirectory of the distribution. See
the README in the same directory for usage instructions.

The configuration editor is part of the WUMprep4Weka project, that aims at
integrating WUMprep in the Weka collection of machine learning algorithms 
for data mining tasks (see http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/). In
particular, WUMprep4Weka will allow to use Weka's "knowledge flow" GUI
interface for defining a sequence of log file preparation steps in an 
intuitive, graphical manner.

Please check http://www.hypknowsys.org for the current state of WUMprep4Weka
development. If you feel excited about the idea of an graphical tool for
log file preparation, and if you would like to contribute, just contact
cp@cpohle.de ;-).


Tools overview
===============

Before using any of the WUMprep scripts, BE SURE TO READ EACH SCRIPT'S
DOCUMENTATION!!! For many scripts, documentation is provided as POD
inline documentation, which can be viewed easily using the 'perldoc'
command. If there is no inline documentation for a script, please
refer to the source code's comments or the usage information printed
by some of the scripts when called with the '--help' option or without
any command line arguments.

Following is a list of the files comprising the Perl parts of the
WUMprep modules of the WUM architecture (in alphabetical order):


Perl scripts and modules:
--------------------------

anonymizeLog.pl     Remove host identifiers from log files and replace
                    them by anonymous numeric IDs

countRequests.pl    Counts the number of requests for each document occurring
                    in a logfile - just a little utility

detectRobots.pl     Identify requests stemming from robots. Tags the records
                    accordingly in the WUMwarehouse if in warehouse mode. If
                    run in file mode, the log entries caused by robots are
                    removed from the output and stored in a separate file.

dnsLookup.pl        Perform (reverse) hostname lookups. Invoke with
                    --help for a list of command line options.
                    ATTENTION: Performs reverse lookups by default (IP
                    to hostname). The logfile template MUST contain an
                    @host_ip@ field!

logFilter.pl        Remove irrelevant logfile records like requests of images or
                    stylesheets. Also to be used for removing duplicated
                    requests.

logStatistics.pl    Calculate descriptive statistics from a logfile

mapReTaxonomies.pl  Regular expression-based conceptual scaling for
                    flat log files

mapTaxonomies.pl    Conceptual scaling for flat log files, DEPRECATED

mergeSessions.pl    Insert requests from another logfile into an already
                    sesionized one.

removeRobots.pl     Predecessor of 'detectRobots.pl', kept for reference
                    purposes - DEPRECATED

removeSessionTails.pl  A little utility that gets the first request of
                    eatch session

sessionFilter.pl    Performs filtering of log lines on session based
                    constraints.

sessionize.pl       Identify user sessions

transformLog.pl     Transform a log file into another format. The script
                    can transform a log file both into another sequential
                    format specified in a user-defined template, and
                    into a vector format with one record per session and
                    all possible instantiations of "path" as dimensions.
                  
WUMprep.pm          Provides helper functions for the WUMprep scripts

WUMprep::Config.pm  Encapsulates the wumprep.conf file; used by the 
                    other scripts to read configuration options

WUMwarehouse.pm     Provides an API for accessing the WUM data warehouse

WUMwarehosue::Config.pm  Encapsulates the wumwarehouse.conf file


Other files:
-------------
configEditor/*	    Graphical WUMprep configuration editor (see above).

doc/*               Documentation files (at least a first impression of what
                    might come in the future ;-))

html/*              Files used by the report mechanism of the
                    logStatistics.pl script

src/indexers.lst    Robot database used by the detectRobots.pl and
                    removeRobots.pl scripts

src/logfileTemplate A sample logfile format definition template

src/logfileTemplate.csv Example template file for transformLog.pl, intended
                    for converting a log file into a comma separated
                    format which can easily be imported into third-party tools.

src/wumprep.conf    Example configuration file for the WUMprep scripts

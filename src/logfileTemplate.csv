# This is a sample logfile template file. It is used to specify the format
# of a logfile to be imported by the importLogfile.pl Perl script, which is
# part of the WUMprep suite.  Besides of comment lines like this, the
# template file contains only one line, defining the format of a single
# line from the log.

# A log line may consist of the following fields:
# @vhost@		- name of the virtual host receiving the http-request
# @host_dns@   - host name (or IP address if it could not be resolved)
# @host_ip@     - host IP address
# @ident@       - ident code
# @auth_user@   - user authentication code
# @ts_day@      - timestamp of the request
# @ts_month@
# @ts_year@
# @ts_hour@
# @ts_minutes@
# @ts_seconds@
# @tz@          - time zone (e.g., +0200)
# @method@      - request method (GET, PUT)
# @path@        - path/URL of the requested document
# @args@        - optional arguments (query), following the @path@ with
#                 an '?' as delimiter (needs only to be specified in template
#                 when stored in a separate field)
# @protocol@    - protocol used for the request
# @status@      - server response code
# @sc_bytes@    - number of bytes sent by server to client
# @cs_bytes@    - number of bytes received by server from client
# @referrer@    - referrer information (URL)
# @agent@       - user agent information
# @time_taken@  - time required to process the request
# @cookie@      - cookie string (may contain several somehow 
#                 separated cookies)
# @ignore@      - as the name says: ignored during processing
# @ignore[1..10]- further ignored fields
# @session_id@

# The template definition is interpreted _literally_, so be careful
# setting commas and blanks.

# The following is a sample template line. You might modify it in order to
# match the format of the specific logfile you want to process.

"@session_id@","@host_dns@","@ts_year@-@ts_month@-@ts_day@ @ts_hour@:@ts_minutes@:@ts_seconds@","@path@"
